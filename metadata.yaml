description: She stooped once more to pick up something which had fallen out when
  the cover was jarred open. It was a pink papier-mâché angel, such as are often hung
  from the top of Christmas trees as a crowning symbol. Norah stood holding it between
  thumb and finger, staring amazedly. Who would think to find such a bit of frivolity
  in the house of Miss Terry! The Christmas Angel is a stirring reminder of what really
  matters at Christmas and throughout the year.
